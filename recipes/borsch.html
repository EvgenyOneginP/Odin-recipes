    <p>Today, every family has its own recipe for borscht. Beans, mushrooms, smoked meats, and even celery are added to
        the
        pan.
        We will teach you how to cook the perfect traditional borsch.</p>

    <ul>For the broth:
        <li>1½-2 liters of water;</li>
        <li>400-500 g of pork or beef on the bone.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>For frying:
        <li>2 small beets;</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot;</li>
        <li>3 medium onions;</li>
        <li>4-5 tablespoons of vegetable oil;</li>
        <li>a pinch of citric acid, a little table vinegar or ½ lemon;</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of tomato paste.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>For borsch:
        <li>300 g of fresh white cabbage;</li>
        <li>4 medium potatoes;</li>
        <li>salt — to taste;</li>
        <li>1-2 dried bay leaves;</li>
        <li>greens — to taste;</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic — optional;</li>
        <li>a pinch of ground cloves — optional;</li>
        <li>a pinch of ground black pepper is optional.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour cold water into a saucepan, lay out the meat and put it on medium heat.
            The broth will taste better if you use meat on the bone.Wash and peel the beets, carrots and onions.
            Grate the beets on a coarse grater, and the carrots on medium. Cut the onion into small cubes.</li>

        <li>Pour oil into a frying pan, turn on medium heat. Fry the onion and carrot, stirring, for about 5 minutes.
            When the broth is cooked, remove the meat from it. While it cools down, pour the chopped cabbage into the
            pan.
            After 5-10 minutes, add the potatoes cut into strips or cubes.</li>

        <li>The order of laying vegetables can be changed.
            If the cabbage is young, it is better to add it after the potatoes.
            Well, or at the same time, if your potato variety is boiled quickly.</li>
    </ol>
