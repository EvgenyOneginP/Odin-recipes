    <p>Recipes for grated potato pancakes similar to Belarusian draniki can be found
        in the German, Czech, Irish, Norwegian, American and Ukrainian cuisines.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>12 potatoes</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Peel, wash and grate potatoes and the onion (the onion will help you keep grated potatoes from turning
            brown).
            Use a grater with small holes. Add salt and mix until a smooth even consistency is obtained.</li>
        <li>Heat the frying pan with vegetable oil. Put a full tablespoon of mixture from the bowl onto the frying pan
            and form a small pancake.
            Flip over once browned and crispy - about 2 to 3 minutes each side.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
